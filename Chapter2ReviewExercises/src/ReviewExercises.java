	 * Chapter 2 Review Exercises 
1.	An object is an entity you can manipulate in your program, while an object reference refers to the memory location of an object.
2.	An object is an entity you can manipulate in your program, while an object variable is a reference variable to that object that can manipulate it.
3.	An object is an entity you can manipulate in your program (of a class), while a class is a list of method that you can apply to its objects.
4. Object:		new Rectangle(5,5,10,10);
	Object Variable:	Rectangle box
5. In Java, = is the assignment operator and means "gives the value of", while in math, it means that both sides are equal.
6. Code:
	Rectangle box = new Rectangle(75, 75, 50, 50);
	String greeting = "Hello, Dave!";
7. Code (using object variables)
	Rectangle box2 = box;
	String greeting2 = greeting;
8. a) Rectangle r = new Rectangle(5, 10, 15, 20);
   b) double width = new Rectangle(5, 10, 15, 20).getWidth():
   c) Rectangle r = new Rectangle(5, 10, 15, 20);
   	  r.translate(15, 25);
   d) Rectangle r = new Rectangle(5, 10, 15, 20);
   	  r.translate(420, 360);
9. getWidth() and getHeight() are accessors, and translate() and setSize() are mutators
10. the add() method of the Rectangle Class manipulates a Rectangle Object so that the point specified in the parameters of 
	the add() method lies on the perimeter of the Rectangle. 
11. Overloaded method of the String Class:		println()
12. Overloaded method of the Rectangle Class:	add()   (multiple methods named add() with different parameters)
